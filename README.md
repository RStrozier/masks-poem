Customization
If you would like to customize the animated poem, you can follow these guidelines:

Fonts
The project uses custom fonts to enhance the visual appeal of the poem. To change the fonts, follow these steps:

Locate the font files in the project directory.

Replace the font files with your desired fonts. Make sure to keep the same file names and formats.

Open the CSS file (styles.css) located in the project directory.

Locate the font declarations and update the font names accordingly:

css
Copy
@font-face {
  font-family: 'CustomFontName';
  src: url('path/to/custom-font.woff2') format('woff2'),
       url('path/to/custom-font.woff') format('woff');
  /* Add additional font formats if necessary */
}

/* Update font usage in styles */
body {
  font-family: 'CustomFontName', sans-serif;
}
Animation Behavior
If you wish to modify the animation behavior triggered by the Intersection Observer, you can make changes to the JavaScript code. Follow these steps:

Open the script.js file located in the project directory.

Locate the Intersection Observer setup:

javascript
Copy
const observer = new IntersectionObserver((entries) => {
  // Perform actions based on intersections
  entries.forEach((entry) => {
    if (entry.isIntersecting) {
      // Trigger animation for the specific section
      // Add your custom animation logic here
    }
  });
});

// Specify the sections to observe
const sections = document.querySelectorAll('section');

// Observe each section
sections.forEach((section) => {
  observer.observe(section);
});
Customize the animation logic within the if (entry.isIntersecting) block. You can add your own animations or modify existing ones to suit your needs.

Save the changes and refresh the webpage to see the updated animation behavior.
